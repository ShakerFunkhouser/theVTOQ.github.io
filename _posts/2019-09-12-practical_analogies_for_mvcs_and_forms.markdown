MVC's and forms are rather anologous to life. Views are what people perceive, models are what are perceptible, and controllers determine what attributes of models are perceptible under certain conditions. Forms are anologous to life in that users (which might as well be thought of as models) can interact with forms embedded in views to allow certain attributes of models to be perceptible. I can attest that drawing these analogies has been helpful to understanding MVC's and forms. For anyone that still has difficulties conceptualizing MVC's and forms, think of how fiction works: the attributes, motives and speculations of some characters (instances of the model "Character") are knowable or, if you like, "perceptible" through the medium or "view". The controller (or "author" or designer") determines when these motives, attriubtes and speculations are knowable by you, the "user". In video games, there are prompts or "forms" to allow you to request perceptible information about instances of models stored in the database. I hope this help anyone who is confused.
