As a longtime hobby I have tried to construct various object-oriented representations of how humans think and feel in particular circumstances, so that I may at last have an idea of how to create value for others. Rather hilariously (if not morbidly) my past suggests that charm can only get you so far in life. Frankly, it is possible that I had the extroardinaryily good luck to be surrounded by people willing to allow me to believe I was somewhat charming for perhaps 60% of my life. Inevitably I had to confront the possibility that my speculations about various people were just that: speculations. Realizing that my conception of people was possibly quite divergent from reality was as humbling (embarrassing) as it was liberating. I often wonder if most people come to such a realization much sooner and with much more ease. Of course, the tone of this article suggests I am still under the impression that I can accrue others' esteem via self-effacement. Oh, the implications...
