The time has come to submit my final project for the Learn.co Full-Stack Web Development curriculum. I have learned a great deal, and this project has been a great opportunity to showcase what I have learned. Of course, my ultimate vision for the project will encompass much more functionality, but this is a serviceable proof of concept- really a reimagining of my Javascript final project using react and redux. Indeed, these frameworks proved invaluable and saved me a lot of headaches that raw javascript inflicted. Specifically, organizing my frontend into containers and presentational components eased my conceptualization of the functionality of the app. 

Among my stretch goals was to allow users to create accounts using Facebook via Omniauth, but researching how to accomplish this with Redux and Rails as an API revealed a rabbit hole that seemed to time-consuming for the purposes of this humble proof-of-concept. I admit, I wish the curriculum had provided some guidance as to how to handle creation and authentication of user accounts using Rails as an API, specifically in conjunction with redux and the Omniauth gem. Nevertheless, that knowledge is undoubtedly extant on the world-wide web, and I am confident that I have what it takes to source and implement it as and when I have the time to do so. 

And with that, I would like to take thank the entire team at Learn.co for ostensibly saving me considerable time on my journey to prototyping my dreams. I will be recommending your service to any of my family, friends and acquaintances interested in a career in web-development. Now, it's time for me to make my mark on the ever-evolving world of cyberspace. Godspeed, and stay inspired everyone!
