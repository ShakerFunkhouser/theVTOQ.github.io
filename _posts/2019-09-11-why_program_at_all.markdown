If you are reading this blog or visiting this sight you are at least tangentially interested in producing code or having code produced for. It may have escaped your notice, but blue-collar jobs are increasingly more affordable to replace with automation- soon white collar jobs may even follow suit. I don't want to seem alarmist, but you may want to consider carving out an economic niche for yourself in the markets that are emerging and have yet to emerge from this rather rapid technological advancement. Even if you aren't particularly worried, I recommend learning at least the basics of any object-oriented programming language, since doing so has helped make me a more rational and considered person. In particular, considering how to translate real-world conditions, expectations and implications into code has radically transformed the way I perceive the world. I'm sure with a little help from a search engine you can find a multitude of credible claimsthat coding even small-scale projects confers cognitive and emotional benefits, which I wish to emphatically corroborate.
