Well into college I maintained an aversion to computer programming for fear of being stygmatized as a "nerd". Over time, however, I accrued ideas for projects that could only be conceived and delivered online, and, eventually, my yearning for them to take flight overrode any extant reservations. Fortuitously, I began to relish devising and coding solutions to increasingly complex problems, such that the act is somewhat transcendent. Perhaps I could one day yield a digital impression that people would ascribe profundity too, or even take hope or solace in.
