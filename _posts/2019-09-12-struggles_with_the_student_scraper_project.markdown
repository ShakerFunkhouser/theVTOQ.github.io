When completing my Student Scraper project I challenged myself to create a CLI that would operate in response to commands, and cycle through a while loop until the exit command was given. I decided to also have a default order of functions that would trigger, and to give the user commands with which to easily navigate to previous or future functions. This was certainly a logistical challenge, but, frankly, I did not deem the project worthy of presenttation without it, or without some feature of similar complexity. Even so I struggled with doubt that the project was worth developing- it lacked ingenuity in that it basically replicated the user experience when using IMDB.com. To anyone with similar doubt as to the worth of such an endeavor I can only relate what helped me overcome the lassitude I experienced: this learning exercise does not have to be the invention of the next billion-dollar website- though that certainly would be nice. It's nice to challenge yourself, but, at the end of the day you're here to gain experience and skill, even in the absence of inspiration.
