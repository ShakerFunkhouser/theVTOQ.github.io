Part of what drew me to programming was the allure of creating digital analogs for real-world "objects", so to speak. Indeed, I have consistently and confidently leveraged this enduring fascination when completing the lessons and projects in this curriculum, with an important exception. I confess I have very little confidence that I can design satisfying visuals, or relish the process of creating them despite being rather well acquainted with CSS at this point. To people with the same unfortunate disability I recommend that you maintain hope that a muse will imminently endow you with artistic vision. Perhaps she only needs an invitation to manifest such providence. Perhaps she needs more protracted supplication. Perhaps the extent to which you are worthy of her providence depends on the extent to which you have transgressed her sensibilities, in which case you must resolve to expiate any such transgressions forthwith. In other words, get over it and fake it till you make it.
